- in volumes:import sanity check that file is tar gz?
- add tests -- mock network requests
- add command to call oclif upload with `AWS_...` vars from .env
- try auto update plugin? add it / try it / run promote
- try on mac?
- try on ubuntu / hetzner?
- fwup antoine - did it work
- build for macos, ubuntu
- connect with homebrew?
- ubuntu installation instructions?
- look into upgrade plugin
- test upgrade on macos, ubuntu (+fedora + other OSs on hetzner/DO), windows
- look into https://github.com/oclif/plugin-warn-if-update-available
- look into autocomplete
- once cutover, archive disco-cli, point to /cli
- update docs re: installing/upgrading
- use `npm run version` - but copy/paste into docs // generate CLI.md or something instead of readme? and don't git add readme
- set the version (something that's +0.1 more than current homebrew? in line with the python cli version?)
- disable 'plugins'..? i.e. ability to have/add plugins? (and see them in binary's help)
- look into what s3 tarballs upload does (only uploads?) - would prefer to push to releases on github
- enable workflows:
  - when adding tag - build tarballs + make those part of releases? (i.e. tag -> build tarball -> release with files)
  - test on every push
- add some tests to commands
- run tests as part of release process
- command that expect a server (env list, many others) should check first if there's a .disco config at all -- use a parent class for all commands that take / expect a --disco param?
  - should read auth from config call be a oclif hook..? or just utility func called every time? or a parent class to all commands that require auth?
  - https://oclif.io/docs/base_class/ for --disco ? and different one for cli commands expecting disco and project? and call getDisco automatically to set this.discoConfig? or overkill?
- move pattern of calling readEventSource and printing json.parse().text using process.stdout.write into function

ask Rodrigo:

- this.error which doesn't work within request catch fail... because of catch..? or something else..?

- probably not needed anymore....!!!
  - how to patch oclif re: tarball bundling which requires the yarn patch?
  - FIND PERMANENT FIX for yarn --- right now, running `npm run pack` requires manual hack explained here -- https://github.com/oclif/oclif/issues/759#issuecomment-1516581856 -- i.e. need to manually change lib/tarballs/build.js to have different `yarn workspaces ......` line
    - it seems to work now.......!!!
