- FIND PERMANENT FIX for yarn --- right now, running `npm run pack` requires manual hack explained here -- https://github.com/oclif/oclif/issues/759#issuecomment-1516581856 -- i.e. need to manually change lib/tarballs/build.js to have different `yarn workspaces ......` line
- add init command - finish
- read/write auth in .disco/config
- should read auth from config call be a oclif hook..? or just utility func called every time? or a parent class to all commands that require auth?
- how to deal with server side events?
- build for macos, ubuntu
- connect with homebrew?
- ubuntu installation instructions?
- look into upgrade plugin
- test upgrade on macos, ubuntu (+fedora + other OSs on hetzner/DO), windows
- look into https://github.com/oclif/plugin-warn-if-update-available
- look into autocomplete
- once cutover, archive disco-cli, point to /cli
- update docs re: installing/upgrading
  <<<<<<< HEAD
- disable 'plugins'..?
- workflows:
  - create release on tag (test + build)
  - test on every push
- use `npm run readme` - but copy/paste into docs // generate CLI.md or something instead of readme? and don't git add readme
- set the version (something that's +0.1 more than current homebrew? in line with the python cli version?)

(below is maybe duplicate)

- disable 'plugins'..? i.e. ability to have/add plugins? (and see them in binary's help)
- disable most/all github workflows
- look into what s3 tarballs upload does (only uploads?) - would prefer to push to releases on github
- github workflow to actually build tarballs + make those part of releases? when adding tag (i.e. tag -> build tarball -> release with files)
- add some tests to commands
- run tests as part of release process
